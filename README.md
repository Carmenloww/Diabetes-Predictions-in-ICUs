# Diabetes Predictions in ICUs

## Topic:  Diabetes predictions in ICUs

## Purpose:
To determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care.

##  Resources:
Data Source: TrainingWiDS2021.csv, DataDictionaryWiDS2021.csv, APACHE_comorbidity.csv, APACHE_covariate.csv, EHM_test_db.csv, demographics.csv, labs.csv, labs_blood_gas.csv, sqlite_table_data.csv, vitals.csv, EHM_test_clean_data.ipynb

Software: Python 3.9, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, PGAdmin4, Tableau, PostgresSQL

## Questions they hope to answer with the data:
- Who has diabetes?
- Who does not have diabetes?
- Whether we can construct a script that suffices to predict who will, under these same circumstances, have diabetes?

## Communication Protocols:
Our communication protocols will consist of using slack to keep in contact in a group chat. Weekly Zoom calls to discuss the finalization of our decision on our repository on Sundays.
